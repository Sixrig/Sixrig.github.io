			<p>
				My name's Nathan, and I'm a miniature painter. Not that I paint on tiny canvases, but I paint models that are typically 1-7 inches tall, sometimes larger. It's a bit of an expensive hobby, and I'm aiming to go into a well-paid field in order to help support that. Currently, I'm in my 5th and final year of college, and I do not have plans to go to graduate school.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for other things I like, I'm into roguelikes and roguelites, like Noita, Hades, Risk of Rain 2, and 20 Minutes Until Dawn. I also play League of Legends as a jungle main. One of the most frustrating things in games to me is being told how things work, I prefer to just be thrown in with minimal context and bang my head against the wall until I figure out how things work.
			</p>
		<h2 class = "heading"> My Future Career Plans </h3>
		<p>
			Ideally, I go into data science or information science as that is what I am majoring in. However, if my career takes an unexpected turn due to unforseen opportunities, I will follow that path. As I gain more experience in the field, I hope to move to bigger and better projects.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, a career at the end of the day is just something that you tolerate so you can do the things that you like to do. I don't care where I end up working, only that I can. I want to continue doing miniature painting, and hopefully be hired as a display painter at some point in the future for one or two models. I would like to try to follow in Vince Venturella's footsteps, who works a full time desk job and also manages to paint 40-60 hours a week.
